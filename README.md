# Decorators and Mixin Classes in Python

This presenation is about the compositional pattern in Python using Decorators and Mixin Classes. It will focus on how we could utilize compositional pattern in python using ideas of higher order functions and mixin classes. It also goes beyond decorators and into the world of Mixin classes for the advanced compositional pattern by manipulating "method resolution order" in order to achieve the abstractions. See presentation [here](https://slides.com/sagarchamling/decorators-and-mixin-classes-in-python).
